Transient Otoacoustic emissions (TOAEs) or transient evoked Otoacoustic emissions (TEOAEs): Sounds emitted in response to an acoustic stimulus of very short duration; usually clicks but can be tone-bursts. 
The use of otoacoustic emissions (OAEs) during the first few days after birth has proven to be a simple, rapid, accurate and cost-effective neonatal hearing screening. They provide a non-invasive objective indicator of healthy cochlear function and are widely used in universal newborn hearing screening programs.
Fingerprints and iris have being the best person recognition systems. But, unfortunately they are not fool proof. For example usage of fake fingers to unlock a phone and fooling the iris scanner of a phone by taking a high resolution picture of a dummy eye.
So, we decided to look into OAEs since they are unique to each individual since the inner cannot be mimmicked. Simulated OAE (TEOAE) can be produced even by partially deaf people.
We made use of these OAEs and tried to build a person authentication system
